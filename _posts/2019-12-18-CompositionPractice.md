## Python practice

This was created / 18 December 2019

---

Got a cold/flu last week so I stayed home... so obviously like any other sick person out there I decided with this occasion to invest some time on my python skills.

---

## Overview

I wanted to develop a tool with a basic but cool ui for it relatively fast so I went for a simple idea of a Composition Helper tool.

Give the option to the 2d/3d artist to snap a screenshot and then Mirror/Blur or add a rule of third grid on top.

Took this opportunity to use the QtDesigner for Pyside and get a more modern UI look.

---

## Demo

Here is a fast demo how this works:

## What it does

- Takes screenshots of both displays (only 2 supported at the moment)  
- You can select which Display to work on  
- You can Mirror vertically (make scene composition is better if mirrored)  
- You can Blur it (spam it even) to see if readability is good  
- You can "spawn" a rule of third grid  

---

## What I could have done differently or better

- Add a folder selection for where the screenshots will be saved  
- Add a slider for how strong the blur can be (instead of spamming the button)  
- Draw on top of the image for grids instead of adding another image (even if currently its way faster :D)  
- Add the option to have dark or light theme instead of just dark  
- Scaling/Resizing the window would resize/scale the screenshot/ui too

## Notes

If anyone is interested I could make an exe/installer for this so you don't execute the python code everytime.

If not it was really cool that I still haven't forgotten everything regarding Python and even if my code its not the best, it works and it achieved its purpose.

I'm hoping with this Christmas holiday I have more time to invest in Houdini/Python, so who knows? Maybe i'll post something else soon...

Have a nice Christmas and a Happy new year !
